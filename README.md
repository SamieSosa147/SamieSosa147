LitFit is an application that serves to monetize and unveil the sub-retail culture of Thrifting. The application allows local consumers to showcase their local finds (fits), review thrift stores, and comment on other users' visuals. Data implicates 67% of consumers affiliate "second-hand" retail as lesser quality. The point of the application is to disrupt the general perception of thrift shopping; allowing local consumers to view potential pieces they could add to their wardrobe.  The app will integrate technical tools such as HTML, CSS, React and React Hooks. The app's technical skeleton will be backed by the M.E.R.N stack.
