### Hello  :smile:

My name is Samuel Prempeh and I am a tech enthusiast and creative evaluator with experience with javascript, AWS, and Mern-Stack. Utilizing my academic background in political science and economics, I use technology to reflect the digital sub-cultures of a country. When I'm not working, I'm probably browsing through social media apps discovering ways to monetize content, discovering more about Quantum Computing, or creating a virtual bot with UiPath.


## Highlighted Projects
[LitFit](https://github.com/SamieSosa147/LitFit) 

LitFit is an application that serves to monetize and unveil the sub-retail culture of Thrifting. The application allows local consumers to showcase their local finds (fits), review thrift stores, and comment on other users' visuals. Data implicates 67% of consumers affiliate "second-hand" retail as lesser quality. The point of the application is to disrupt the general perception of thrift shopping; allowing local consumers to view potential pieces they could add to their wardrobe.  The app will integrate technical tools such as HTML, CSS, React and React Hooks. The app's technical skeleton is  backed by the M.E.R.N stack. 

[Homecooked](https://github.com/SamieSosa147/Homecooked) 

Homecooked allows users to see a massive variety of ingredients by inputting foods they have at home or cultural cuisines they would like to recreate. With more than 72% of local restaurants modifying their hours of service and employees; Homecooked serves to offer a covid-free dining experience by formulating diverse recipes that mimic foods served in local pre-pandemic restaurants. The recipe generator optimizes queries that are backed by a restful API. 

[A-Lil-Bit-Salty](https://github.com/Salt-Squad/A-Lil-Bit-Salty-backend)

Our app is called A-lil-Bit-Salty. It is picture based food app for people with a uniqie TASTE of humor. The app alows users to submit comments under not-so-attractive foods. Users can select specific pictures they want to comment under. The kicker is, users can update, or even delete anyones comments.It is a community of satire commenting on disgusting images of "delicuous" meals. In the future, we would like to add a feature that allows user's contents as well user authentication, a feature that would only allow a specific user to edit, or delete their own comment.
